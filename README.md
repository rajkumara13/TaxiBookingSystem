🚕 Taxi Booking System (Java Console Project)
📌 Project Overview


This is a simple Java console-based Taxi Booking System.
The system automatically assigns taxis to customers based on availability, distance, and earnings.

It is designed to practice OOP concepts like:

Classes & Objects

Encapsulation

Lists (ArrayList)

Basic logic building

🧩 How the System Works

Customers request a taxi by giving:

Pickup point (A–F)

Drop point

Pickup time

System checks all taxis and selects:

Taxis that are free at the pickup time

Taxi closest to the pickup point

If multiple taxis are same distance, the one with less earnings is chosen

Booking is created and assigned to the selected taxi

Taxi details are updated:

Current location

Free time

Total earnings

Final report is displayed with:

Taxi earnings

All bookings handled by each taxi

🧱 Classes Used
